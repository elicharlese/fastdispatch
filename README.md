Wrapper for plum dispatch to make it more compatible with fastcore’s
typedispatch. Hopefully this is just temporary, and instead the
functionality here will be moved into plum.

## Install

`pip install fastdispatch`

## How to use

`fastdispatch` works just like plum, with a few extensions. We recommend
reading through their [very informative
docs](https://github.com/wesselb/plum), however, here’s a quick example
to get started:

``` python
from fastcore.test import test_fail
from fastdispatch import *
```

Decorate type annotated Python functions with `fastdispatch.dispatch` to
add them as *methods* to a dispatched *function* (following [Julia’s
terminology](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/)):

``` python
@dispatch
def f(x: str):
    return "This is a string!"

@dispatch
def f(x: int):
    return "This is an integer!"
```

``` python
f('1')
```

    'This is a string!'

``` python
f(1)
```

    'This is an integer!'

If there’s no matching method, `plum.NotFoundLookupError` is raised:

``` python
test_fail(lambda: f(1.0), contains='For function "f", signature Signature(builtins.float) could not be resolved.')
```
